## Quick Overview

The Ideathon workflow is simple:

1. **Browse** the available Google technology guides in the sidebar
2. **Download** the prompt files you need
3. **Fill out** the idea submission form with your project details
4. **Use Anti-Gravity** (Google's AI IDE) to build your project automatically

---

## Available Resources

All files are available in the sidebar under two sections:

### Google Technologies

Choose any of the following technologies for your project:

- **Google Maps Platform** - Interactive maps, markers, live tracking, and routes
- **Firebase** - Authentication, real-time databases, and cloud storage
- **Google Gemini AI** - AI chatbots, text analysis, and smart assistants
- **Google Cloud Platform** - Scalable cloud deployment and services
- **Google Authentication** - Secure Google Sign-In integration

Each guide includes:

- Requirements and allowed features
- Tech stack recommendations
- Complete AI prompt template

**Not Limited to These!** You can use **any Google technology** for your project, including:

- Google Sheets API
- Google Drive API
- Google Calendar API
- YouTube Data API
- Google Translate API
- Google Vision API
- And many more!

If you want to use a different Google technology, simply **create your own markdown file** by following the same format as our provided guides. Use them as templates and customize for your chosen technology.

### Ideathon Resources

Essential files for your project:

- **Idea Submission Form** - Template to describe your project idea
- **AI Starter Instructions** - Instructions for Anti-Gravity to build your project

---

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Choose Your Technology

Browse the **Google Technologies** section in the sidebar and pick the one that fits your project idea best. Click on it to read the requirements and features.

### Step 2: Download or Copy Required Files

Each technology guide and resource page provides two options for obtaining the file:

- **Download Button** - Downloads the `.mdx` file directly to your computer
- **Copy Button** - Copies the file content to your clipboard

**Files You Need:**

1. **Starter Instructions** (`starter.mdx`) - Required for all projects
2. **Technology Guide** (e.g., `google-maps.mdx`) - For your chosen technology
3. **Idea Submission Form** (`idea-submission-form.mdx`) - To describe your project

### Step 3: Organize Your Files

Create a project folder and place all downloaded files together:

```
my-ideathon-project/
├── starter.mdx
├── idea-submission-form.mdx
└── google-maps.mdx (or firebase.mdx, gemini.mdx, etc.)
```

### Step 4: Fill Out Your Idea

Open `idea-submission-form.mdx` in any text editor and fill in:

- **Team Details** - Names, year, college
- **Problem Statement** - What problem are you solving?
- **Your Idea** - Describe your app/website in simple words
- **Features** (Optional) - List features if you know them
- **UI Preferences** (Optional) - Describe your desired design

**Don't worry if you don't know everything!** The AI will help fill in the gaps.

### Step 5: Use Anti-Gravity

Open your project folder in **Anti-Gravity** (Google's AI IDE) and paste this instruction:

```
Read the starter.mdx file in this project folder and follow all instructions.
Use the idea from idea-submission-form.mdx and the technology guide to build a complete working project.
```

Anti-Gravity will:

- Read all your markdown files
- Generate complete source code
- Create a modern UI with animations
- Set up Google API integration
- Provide setup instructions

### Step 6: Run and Test

After Anti-Gravity generates your project:

1. Follow the setup instructions in the generated README
2. Get your Google API keys (instructions will be provided)
3. Run the project locally
4. Test all features
5. Customize as needed

3. **Customize** - Replace the content with your chosen Google technology:
   - Change the title and description
   - List the features and APIs you'll use
   - Update the requirements
