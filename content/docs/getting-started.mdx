## Welcome to the Ideathon

This guide will help you build a complete project using Google technologies with the help of AI. Even if you're a beginner, you'll be able to create something amazing.

## How This Works

1. **Choose a Google Technology** - Pick from Maps, Firebase, Gemini AI, Cloud, or Auth
2. **Download the Guide** - Get the markdown file for your chosen technology
3. **Use Anti-Gravity** - Let Google's AI IDE build your project
4. **Submit Your Project** - Show off what you've built

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Technology

Pick **ONE** Google technology you want to use in your project:

- **Google Maps** - Build location-based apps with interactive maps ([View Guide](/docs/google-maps))
- **Firebase** - Create apps with authentication and databases ([View Guide](/docs/firebase))
- **Gemini AI** - Build AI-powered chatbots and smart apps ([View Guide](/docs/gemini))
- **Google Cloud** - Deploy scalable cloud applications ([View Guide](/docs/google-cloud))
- **Google Auth** - Add Google Sign-In to your app ([View Guide](/docs/google-auth))

### Step 2: Download the Required Files

You need to download **TWO** markdown files:

1. **Starter Instructions** - [View starter.mdx](/docs/starter)
2. **Your Technology Guide** - Download the guide for your chosen technology
3. **Idea Submission Form** - [View idea-submission-form.mdx](/docs/idea-submission-form)

**How to Download:**

- Right-click on the page and select "Save As" then save as `.mdx` file
- Or copy all the content and paste into a new `.mdx` file

### Step 3: Set Up Your Project Folder

Create a new folder for your project and add the downloaded files:

```
my-ideathon-project/
├── starter.mdx
├── idea-submission-form.mdx
└── google-maps.mdx (or your chosen technology)
```

### Step 4: Fill Out the Idea Submission Form

Open `idea-submission-form.mdx` and fill in:

- Your team details
- Problem you're solving
- Your idea (in simple words)
- Features you want (optional)
- UI preferences (optional)

**Note:** The AI will help you figure out the details even if you don't know everything.

### Step 5: Use Anti-Gravity (Google IDE)

Now comes the magic! Open your project in **Anti-Gravity** (Google's AI IDE) and give it this instruction:

```
Read the starter.mdx file in this project folder and follow all instructions.
Use the idea from idea-submission-form.mdx and the technology guide to build a complete working project.
```

**That's it!** Anti-Gravity will:

- Read all your markdown files
- Understand your idea
- Generate complete source code
- Create a modern UI with animations
- Set up everything you need

### Step 6: What Happens Next

Anti-Gravity will create:

- Complete project structure
- Frontend code with modern UI
- Backend code (if needed)
- Google API integration
- Setup instructions
- README file

You just need to:

1. Follow the setup instructions
2. Get your Google API keys (instructions will be provided)
3. Run the project
4. Test and customize it
