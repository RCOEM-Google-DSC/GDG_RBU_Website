## Welcome to GitHub!

This guide will help you set up Git and GitHub from scratch, even if you've never used them before. By the end, you'll be able to clone projects, make changes, and push your code to GitHub.

---

## What is Git and GitHub?

**Git** is a tool that helps you track changes in your code. Think of it like a "save game" feature for your projects.

**GitHub** is a website where you can store your Git projects online and share them with others.

**GitHub CLI** is a command-line tool that makes it super easy to work with GitHub directly from your terminal.

---

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Account

If you don't have a GitHub account yet:

1. Go to [github.com](https://github.com)
2. Click **Sign up**
3. Choose to sign up with an OAuth provider for ease, or fill in your email, password, username, and country
4. Verify your email address
5. Complete the setup

## Step 4: Configure Git with Your Information

Now that Git is installed, you need to tell it who you are. This information will be attached to your commits.

1. **Open your terminal** (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or Terminal)

2. **Set your name** (replace with your actual name):

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "Your Name"
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.name "John Doe"
   ```

3. **Set your email** (use the same email as your GitHub account):

   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   git config --global user.email "john.doe@gmail.com"
   ```

4. **Verify your configuration**:

   ```bash
   git config --list
   ```

   You should see your name and email in the output.

---

## Step 5: Authenticate with GitHub using GitHub CLI

This is the easiest way to connect to GitHub! GitHub CLI will handle all the authentication for you.

### Login to GitHub

1. **Run the authentication command:**

   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```

2. **Follow the interactive prompts:**

   ![GitHub CLI Authentication](/docs/gh-auth-login.png)
   - **What account do you want to log into?**
     - Select `GitHub.com` (use arrow keys and press Enter)

   - **What is your preferred protocol for Git operations?**
     - Select `HTTPS` (recommended for beginners)

   - **Authenticate Git with your GitHub credentials?**
     - Select `Yes`

   - **How would you like to authenticate GitHub CLI?**
     - Select `Login with a web browser` (easiest option)

3. **Complete the browser authentication:**
   - A code will appear in your terminal (e.g., `ABCD-1234`)
   - Press Enter to open your browser
   - If it doesn't open automatically, go to [github.com/login/device](https://github.com/login/device)
   - Enter the code shown in your terminal
   - Click **Authorize GitHub CLI**
   - You'll see a success message!

4. **Verify you're logged in:**

   ```bash
   gh auth status
   ```

   ![GitHub CLI Authentication Success](/docs/gh-auth-success.png)

   You should see: `✓ Logged in as your-username`

**That's it!** You're now authenticated and ready to use Git and GitHub. No need to remember passwords or create tokens! 

---

## Step 6: Basic Git Commands

Now you're ready to use Git! Here are the essential commands you'll use every day.

### Clone a Repository (Download a Project)

**Cloning** means downloading a project from GitHub to your computer.

#### Using GitHub CLI (Easiest!)

```bash
gh repo clone username/repository-name
```

Example:

```bash
gh repo clone github-repository-link
```

#### Using Git (Traditional Method)

1. **Find the repository on GitHub**
2. **Click the green "Code" button**
3. **Copy the HTTPS URL**

4. **In your terminal, navigate to where you want the project:**

   ```bash
   cd Desktop
   ```

5. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   ```

6. **Navigate into the project:**

   ```bash
   cd repository-name
   ```

   Example:

   ```bash
   cd GDG_RBU_Website
   ```

### Check Status (See What Changed)

See which files you've modified:

```bash
git status
```

This shows:

-  Files that are ready to commit (green)
-  Files that are modified but not staged (red)
-  New files that aren't tracked yet

### Add Files (Stage Changes)

Before you can save (commit) your changes, you need to **stage** them.

**Add a specific file:**

```bash
git add filename.txt
```

**Add all changed files:**

```bash
git add .
```

Example:

```bash
git add index.html
```

Or add everything:

```bash
git add .
```

### Commit Changes (Save Your Work)

A **commit** is like saving a checkpoint in your project.

```bash
git commit -m "Your message describing what you changed"
```

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Added navigation bar to homepage"
```

**Tips for good commit messages:**

- Be clear and specific
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Keep it short (under 50 characters if possible)

### Push Changes (Upload to GitHub)

**Pushing** sends your commits from your computer to GitHub.

```bash
git push
```

Or if it's your first push on a new branch:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

**Note:** The default branch might be called `main` or `master` depending on the repository.

### Pull Changes (Download Updates)

If someone else made changes to the project on GitHub, you can download them:

```bash
git pull
```

This updates your local copy with the latest changes from GitHub.

---

## Step 7: Complete Workflow Example

Here's a typical workflow when working on a project:

### Starting a New Project

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   gh repo clone username/my-project
   cd my-project
   ```

2. **Make your changes** (edit files, add new files, etc.)

3. **Check what changed:**

   ```bash
   git status
   ```

4. **Stage your changes:**

   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

5. **Commit your changes:**

   ```bash
   git commit -m "Describe what you did"
   ```

6. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git push
   ```

### Daily Workflow

```bash
# 1. Get the latest changes from GitHub
git pull

# 2. Make your changes to files

# 3. Check what you changed
git status

# 4. Stage all changes
git add .

# 5. Commit with a message
git commit -m "Fixed bug in login form"

# 6. Push to GitHub
git push
```

## Bonus: Useful GitHub CLI Commands

GitHub CLI makes many tasks easier! Here are some helpful commands:

### View Repository Information

```bash
gh repo view
```

### Create a New Repository (interactive mode)

```bash
gh repo create
```




---

## Common Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Starting Fresh with a New Repository

**Create a new repository using GitHub CLI:**

```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub
gh repo create my-project --public --clone

# This creates the repo AND clones it to your computer!
cd my-project

# Add your files
git add .

# Make your first commit
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

### Scenario 2: You Made a Mistake in Your Commit Message

If you just committed and want to change the message:

```bash
git commit --amend -m "New commit message"
```

### Scenario 3: You Want to Undo Changes

**Undo changes to a file (before staging):**

```bash
git checkout -- filename.txt
```

**Unstage a file (after `git add`):**

```bash
git reset filename.txt
```

**Undo the last commit (keep changes):**

```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: "gh: command not found"

**Solution:** GitHub CLI isn't installed or not in your PATH.

- Reinstall GitHub CLI following Step 3
- Close and reopen your terminal
- On Windows, restart your computer if needed

### Problem: "Authentication failed"

**Solution:** You need to login again.

```bash
gh auth login
```

### Problem: "fatal: not a git repository"

**Solution:** You're not in a Git project folder.

- Make sure you're in the correct directory
- Or initialize Git with: `git init`

### Problem: "Your branch is behind 'origin/main'"

**Solution:** Someone else pushed changes. Pull them first:

```bash
git pull
```

### Problem: Merge Conflicts

**Solution:** When two people edit the same file:

1. Git will mark the conflicts in your files
2. Open the file and look for `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`
3. Edit the file to keep what you want
4. Remove the conflict markers
5. Stage and commit:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolved merge conflict"
   git push
   ```
